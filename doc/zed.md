Using the Zed cameras requires installation of the SDK and the python wrapper.

See https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/app-development/python/install/#getting-started for more info.

If you already have the SDK, run the get_python_api script. If you don't have the SDK already, install the SDK which will also install the python API (if you choose to).
